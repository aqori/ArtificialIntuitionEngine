# ArtificialIntuitionEngine

## Description

A hybrid AI framework integrating symbolic reasoning with deep neural networks, utilizing attention-based graph neural networks for knowledge graph embedding and probabilistic logic inference for explainable decision-making.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for an Artificial Intuition Engine software project:
- "Employs hierarchical temporal memory architecture for pattern recognition and anomaly detection",
- "Utilizes transfer learning to adapt pretrained neural networks to new problem domains",
- "Integrates uncertainty quantification methods to provide confidence intervals for predictions",
- "Supports realtime data ingestion and processing from various sensor modalities",
- "Features an explainability module to generate visualizations of decisionmaking processes",
- "Leverages cognitive architectures to model humanlike reasoning and decisionmaking",
- "Includes an optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning and model selection"
- Let me know if you'd like me to generate more!
## Installation
